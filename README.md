# Foundamental's of Numpy
Numpy is a tremendous Tool for manipulation of array, unlike the normal array's in python. Numpy has made it possible for us to explore array much faster and create complicated iterations.

Numpy was created to change the standard of list creation in python. Moreover, this library is able to handle functions of linear algebra, matrices etc.

Hence, making this library one the most popular lib within the world of Data science.

Numpy array's are 50x faster then normal python lists, due to the reason that Numpy array's are stored in a continous fashion inside the memory unlike lists.
